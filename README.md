My Website is about Fitness And Gym Related. It mainly focuses on a gym training center which guides and teaches people to have a good fitness.

This was a really big project for me. I have designed this website with utmost care! 

I will break down my full website designing in 5 breakpoints.

1) UI Designing
- I have gotten my idea of the website from colorlib. I researched a lot of website to go perfectly with my taste. 
- I have divide my website in 5 pages excludin signin/signup.
- Each page has different contents.
- The home page has different type of sections.
- I have used Bootstarp cdn and react bootstrap to design the responsiveness of the UI.
- Mostly used 3 colors throughout the website.
- Every page has header and footer.
- I have created a not found page too in case pages are not available.
2) Structure
- I have divided the websites in to various components.
- The src file have hooks ,context and components in different folder.
- The component folder has A main Folder call pages. Where i have kept all of the Navs and their selective pages individually.
- The Home folder has various child components on it!
- Also i placed the privateroute folder in the signin component.
3) Data
- I have fetched data from public folder which i myself created for the website.
- Gave the json files datas individual keys to avoid warning.
- Most of the images are url based and are from pexels.
4) Router
- I have implemented react router dom.
- This helps us to walk thorugh between different pages without reloadin.
- I have placed the routes on app.js ! and wrapped them around Authcontext. Every route has there different loctions.
- I have implemented dynamic route on the service section of the home page to redirect us to selected data's detailed information.
5) Firebase Authentication
- The most tricky part was firebase authentication
- i have created a firebase project and hosted my files on it as an web app.
- i have implemented two authorization for my sign in.
- First one is with using google and second one with email and password.
- The user information will be stored on my firebase project.
- I have also implement verification of email, reset password.
- The header shows the users name everytime the user signs in.

This project was really important part for me! I really enjoyed doing it!
